Prologue </h3>
			
<p class="text">
I don’t remember when I first found out that Opa Harry was a famous magician. We rarely discussed it in our family, but when we did, it seemed quite ordinary: other grandpas owned farms, prepared food in restaurants, built houses. Mine passed on his secretive skills to aspiring conjurers in his magic studio. </p>

<p class="text">
The wizards that fascinated me as a little girl were Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley and Harry Potter, we all started school in the same year. Hogwarts taught them to fight against the evil in the magic world, riding brooms and spying on menacing beings on the Marauder’s Map, while my sister and I used every opportunity to boastfully reveal that our Opa Harry, too, was a powerful magician. Tales that children love to tell, carefully hiding what we didn’t understand. Living hundreds of kilometers away, in the northern part of Germany, we grew up with our heroes in books and movies, but barely knew the man behind our vivid imagination. We thought he was tall and powerful, but also a little frightening. </p>

<p class="text">
Even when we grew older, our grandfather didn’t play a part in our lives. Though he was a nice and welcoming man, I never felt connected to him. Maybe we weren’t interesting enough - my sister and I didn’t discuss the politics of the Second Gulf War, nor have we travelled to Korea or Hong Kong by the time we turned ten - maybe he just didn’t know how to act around children. </p>
</div>

<p class="text">
In 2005, Opa Harry died. Only after his death did my father decide to tell us about his life and I slowly started to grasp what all of this was about. He took us on a trip to Paris, where my grandfather once filled two thousand seats night after night, sharing a stage with superstars like Édith Piaf and Johnny Hallyday, Pink Floyd, Céline Dion or Aretha Franklin. I still remember clearly how my father toured tirelessly through a magic museum, explaining to us the undenyable significance of twinkling spheres, golden ducats and treasure chests. Requisites that were paramount to Opa Harry’s success. </p>

<p class="text">
What I now write didn’t touch me as a child. Too far detached seemed his world from mine. But I now wish I had memories of sitting on his lap, listening for hours to the stories that a man like him would have been able tell. I recently turned 25 and yet I don’t know who my grandfather was. After passing the theatre in Paris for the fifth time, I decided that I need to find out more. </p>

<p class="text">
Naturally, I start digging for information online. Zauber-Pedia, a German encyclopedia that specialises on the art of magic, gives a first overview: born in the Netherlands in 1936, winning first prizes at Dutch magic conventions, later performing under the stage name of Di Sato - the satan. I find an old video on a Japanese website from one of his performances and read that his act was one of the most original that the magic world has ever seen. But blog posts in Spanish and Portuguese also reveal that my grandfather was responsible for one of the greatest scandals in the world of magic. I soon realise that a search on Google doesn’t help - a WhatsApp message to my grandmother does: two days later I find a letter in my postbox meticulously listing phone numbers and email addresses of Opa Harry’s magic colleagues all around Europe. And so my journey begins. </p>

<h3 class="chapter1">
Chapter 1: Dolly Thiery </h3>

<p class="text">
It’s the summer of 1959 in Haarlem, a city just outside of Amsterdam, in the northwest of the Netherlands. The melodic tones of Beethoven’s For Elise fill the living room, slowly making their way upstairs. The gracile hands of a young woman seamlessly slide across the ivories. Her curly brown hair immaculately frames the tanned face, one side tucked behind her ear. She sits upright and her straight back showcases the flowery dress she sewed for herself. Suddenly, a young man enters the salon, lured by her peaceful melodies. His piercing blue eyes are fixated on her. Without a word he takes two eggs out of the fridge, before resting his tall posture in front of her piano, smiling whimsically. </p>

<p class="text">
“He saw me and started manipulating the eggs. He made them disappear”, my grandmother Dolly says, clapping her hands. “That was the very first time I saw him”, she adds almost in trance, while humming For Elise. Hers and Harry’s sister were friends and she came along one day to play the piano. “I still had another boyfriend, but he impressed me”, my grandmother says. </p>

<p class="text">
My grandparents casually see each other numerous times afterwards until one Sunday afternoon Harry appears on the driveway of Dolly’s family home. Well-dressed in his white chemise, rolled up so that his strong, tan arms become clearly visible. He opens the door of his green peugeot and invites her in. Together, they drive to Arnhem, a small city just an hour away. Dolly dreams of attending a theatre school there, but instead they spend their day drinking coffee at a small café close to the train station and talking for hours during long walks through the town. </p>

<p class="text">
“I was so in love with him back then”, she says with the strong Dutch accent that I love about her. “He was so interesting, such a special kind of man. I was fascinated by his magical world. Also, he had a car. No one at the time had a car”, she says, still slightly impressed. So why did he then? “Harry always had everything”, she bursts out without thinking. Then, after a short pause of reflection: “He probably needed it to drive around his props.” In June 1963, my grandparents got married. </p>
</div>

<div class="col">
<p class="text">
My grandmother stops talking. She looks up from the mint tea in her hand and looks at me.
“You sometimes remind me of him. You also look a bit like his mother”, she says and I can feel her eyes inspecting my face more closely than usually. I do look like a Thiery, I realise, with my slim upper lip and the tiny gaps between my teeth. I also have what we refer to as the Thiery-nose which is just a little bit more pronounced than others. A strange feeling of honor and pride unfurls in my body. </p>

<p class="text">
Harry grew up in South Africa and later moved to Haarlem, a city in the Netherlands, where his father got a job at a magazine. Here, my grandfather learned his first tricks. “Father was a meritorious amateur actor”, Harry would later tell the journalists. He gave him a magic kit and taught him simple pranks with cards and matches. “Making small wonders, that’s fascinating”, Harry would go on. </p>

<p class="text">
He probably didn’t foresee that soon, he would fill nightclubs all around the world with his breathtaking acts. “Your grandfather noticed right away that he had a talent for it, he was born with it. Artists are born, personalities are born. You either have it or not”, Dolly says like an agent. </p>

<p class="text">
Dolly also stitched his costumes, with fabric she bought at the weekly market: his devilish black jacket, sometimes with collar, other times without, his pants, with elastane, so that his body could move freely on stage, his countless capes and cloths. “Some became nasty after a while, full of smoke, others had scorch marks”, she recalls and hands out her favourite photo to me. </p>

<h3 class="chapter1">
Chapter 2: John Elfrink </h3>

<p class="text">
Oma Dolly gives me a list of phone numbers that I work down one by one. I do background research on all the magicians, trying to gather as much information as possible. But only few of them are still alive. Many stories will be gone forever, such as those of Richard Ross, one of his greatest competitors. The Netherlands gradually became the Mecca of magicians in the 1950s and 1960s, with an exclusive circle of Dutch wizards: Tommy Wonder, Fred Kaps, Flip Hallema and Tonny van Dommelen. They were the best of the best, winning national and international Grand Prix, travelling the world. </p>

<p class="text">
I’m able to track down John Elfrink, one of my grandfather’s closest confidantes. When he agrees to meet me in his and Harry’s hometown of Haarlem, I jump slightly, trying to supress my excitement on the phone. I’ve never met any of of my grandfather’s friends and colleagues before. After all, I don’t even have a real memory of Opa Harry himself. </p>

<p class="text">
John is already expecting me. He’s sitting outside on his balcony which is overgrown by green plants and shrubs, the leaves of a large tree form a roof from behind his chair. John is well prepared: he neatly arranged old photographs and flyers he designed for Harry on the wooden table in front of him, together with two pages of notes, ensuring that he won’t forget any important details. He looks more like a retired accountant to me than a magician, with his blue vest and glasses. But how would I know how magicians dress. John’s body seems fragile, his face slim and his movements slow, trembling, but his mind is crystal clear: “I remember everything from the golden years”, he says when he spots me and I can see the thrill in his small eyes. “Harry and I loved to make people completely crazy”, John says. The words of the 86-year-old man in front of me turn into a loud, hearty laugh, while he travels back in time. </p>

<p class="text">
Amsterdam, Leidseplein, 1961. Neon signs are lurring thirsty people into bars, blinking lights provide for the right amount of adrenaline and fast-pumping hearts on their night out. Dave Brubeck Quartet’s newly released Take Five, which would soon become the biggest-selling jazz single of all time, is echoing from the city’s first nightclub around the corner. Stuffy air leaves the venue while opening the heavy entrance door. Sexy, bare-bosomed dancers are moving their bottoms delicately to the rhythm of the seductive sound of a saxophone, driving sweaty men wild. Set in the heart of the nightclub, a small stage. The man performing, my grandfather. Even from far behind you can spot his white teeth, revealed by his persistent smile. He throws small balls in the air - but instead of falling back down, they disappear. More and more balls appear in his hands, though they had been empty just before. </p>

</div>
<div class="col">

<p class="text">
Meanwhile, Henk Vermeyden, a well-established magic organiser and dealer is out hunting for talent. He spots the young Harry on one of the many small stages of clubs and cabarets. Henk has already seen many gifted magicians in his life, he coaches the Dutch world champions Richard Ross and Fred Kaps, but this guy is new: young, fresh, different, a perfect addition to his collection - and a great way to make lots of money through commissions. </p>

<p class="text">
“Henk Vermeyden, die moet u ook vermijden”, John says while rolling his eyes. “He had his fingers everywhere. But your grandfather didn’t like it. Harry wanted to be his own boss. He’s not somebody who would submit to a higher power”, he explains. The catch: Henk was not only the ruler of the nightclub business, but he also founded the International Federation of Magic Societies in 1946 which is the organising association of the world championships. He was also the founding president of the Dutch Magic Society - an important man, if you wanted to make it in magic at that time. Obviously, Henk wasn’t too pleased when my grandfather rejected him. “They got into a huge fight”, John recalls. </p>

<p class="text">
“Harry always had monthly contracts with nightclubs when he began his magic career”, John explains. “Everything was there, ladies who picked up men, dancers, singers, everything. Just like the Crazy Horse or Moulin Rouge in Paris”, he adds. “He was very good looking, he had a good style. Your grandmother wasn’t too happy about all of this, as you can imagine”, he says with a wink. I can. I won’t ask further. Is this where you and Harry met? “He approached me in 1954, when I was conjuring for Dai Vernon’s show, a famous magician from Canada. After my performance, your 18-year-old grandfather asked me to help him with his act”, he recalls. </p>

<p class="text">
And so John began to design flyers and letterheads with our family’s coat of arms, to take extravagant photos of him and to direct his number. Together, they brainstormed to make his act perfect, impressive enough to be better than anyone else in the world. Few years later, in 1964, Harry strives to win the World Championships at the congress in Barcelona. “His act, poetical manipulations, is born of the same obsession which made men like Grock and Houdini great… the will to demonstrate something unprecedented and distinctive to the world, to surprise, to astonish, to move”, Harry’s flyer reads. </p>

<p class="text">
On stage, a perfectly groomed young man in a purple suit and a black bow tie, that twinkle when the bright headlights hit. He’s smiling charmingly while manipulating cards and coins so perfectly timed with theatrical piano music that it resembles visual poetry. Harry is rubbing his hands when suddenly, decks of cards appear out of nowhere, lined up between his fingers, as if a card player was about to start his move. More cards fall out of his stretched hand, as if he was beaming them there, solely using his strength of his mind. A fantastic performance that’s usually perfect enough to win the world championships. </p>

<p class="text">
After Harry’s act, many more magicians try to convince the jury of their talents. Then, when night comes, it’s time for the most important part of the congress, the award ceremony. My grandfather and John sit right next to each other in the audience. They don’t say a word, while the jury reads out the winners of the important magic competition in the whole world: “The honor of the first prize for Stage Illusions goes to the Swiss Les Andreals.” Thankfully, this wasn’t the category that my grandfather wanted to win. He specialises in the art of manipulation. The awards for comedy magic are given out, then those for micromagic. Then, it’s time for manipulation. The jury reads out the winners: “The third award in the category of manipulation goes to Fred Sherry! And the winner of the second prize is… Harry Thiery!” </p>

<p class="text">
Suddenly, there is confusion in the auditorium. The first award is not given out. Utterly absurd, there is no reason. This has never happened before. My grandfather wins his division, there was noone in the world better than him, but still cannot call himself the world champion. Journalists will later question the objectiveness of the jury. John and Harry predict that Henk Vermeyden, the rejected magic dealer, was responsible for this disaster. My grandfather was sure that his greatest opponent had his hands in there. </p>

<p class="text">
“Harry was a very intelligent man”, my grandmother told me the day before. “He loved to make use of misdirection.” She pronounces the word misdirection as if Harry had invented it himself. Long before the next world championship in Baden-Baden, three years later, he started to plan his escapade. Harry told the Dutch newspaper Het Parool: “You can well believe that I will present my manipulation act there under my real name again.” He did, but there is more. </p>

<p class="text">
July 1967, the sky above the Kurhaus in Baden-Baden is magical, the mood exuberant - more than 1100 magicians from 27 countries surge the magnificent building of the spa town in southwestern Germany’s Black Forest, near the border with France. A scintillating chandelier watches over the Bénazetsaal, where the audience is sitting on red theatre seats. A quiet murmur of foreign languages fills the room, while the next magician is preparing his act. It’s almost 12 o'clock, the last spot before the masses will spread around the estate for a jolly lunch. </p>

<p class="text">
Suddenly, darkness. Two clanking drum beats echo through the hall, the murmur freezes. All eyes are gripped by the mysterious creature that, as if by magic, appears on stage. The dark, hairy beast with evil eyes and goatee beard is moving its body in agonizing gestures, accompanied by rattling sounds. Out of complete air, it catches golden ducats. Every step, even the slightest movement of its diabolic fingers is accompanied by electronic music and the sound of violins. On the right side of the stage, an enormous candle. The creature is slowing sliding its red silk cloth between the fire and the plug and waits, 10, 11, 12 seconds. The audience is raddled - not even the slightest harm was done. The satan is fetching more gold pieces out of the air, hiding them in his treasure chest, but then: zzziiiiish, they disappear into no man’s land with a green flash. Gooong, gooong, gooong, roman-catholic church bells ring. The devilish figure shrinks, for a short moment it seems like the religious institution has conquered the evil. But then its powers come back, stronger than ever. The satan makes a golden sphere hover over the ground and through the air. First, close to the creature’s hands, but then further, several meters away, until it disappears, as through a black hole. The music is speeding up, becomes more demanding. Zzziiiish, a death’s head appears on the pillar on the left side of the stage. Fog is fleeing from every crack. Thunderclaps, smoke, devilish laugh, more smoke, gone - the devil disappears. </p>

<div class="col">
<p class="text">
John is wincing on his chair as if he’s suffering from great pain. He seems to have forgotten where we are. “Hahahahaha”, he imitates the satan’s evil laugh. His notes have filled up with sketches, trying to explain my grandfather’s act in exceptional detail. “The jury and the audience went absolutely crazy. They jumped out of their seats and didn’t stop applauding for minutes. Het was heel spectaculair”, he remembers. Journalists would later write that Di Sato’s act “brought the jury and the audience in extase”. But what about his opponent, Henk Vermeyden? </p>

<p class="text">
“No one could know who Di Sato was”, John says solemnly. Only him and Oma Dolly were privy to Harry’s secretive plan of revenge. “He signed up twice, once as Harry Thiery for which he got a terrible sport, in the early morning, when everyone was still asleep, because Henk Vermeyden didn’t like him. But he signed up a second time as Di Sato and nobody recognised him”, Dolly says. </p>

<p class="text">
The days and nights before the crucial performance John and Harry spent every minute polishing the act. “I still remember the terrible smell”, John says while making a face. Harry mixed two chemicals, ammonia and hydrochloric acid, to create the fog, “but not just a little bit, a loooot”, John recalls with his eyes wide open. “It was really like smoke coming out of hell”, he remembers. “Harry focused on this act so much, he put his full heart and soul into it. A FISM performance is really a thing of life and death”, John explains, “he didn’t want to go down on that stage in front of all of those magicians”. </p>

<p class="text">
July 9, 1967, the last day of the World Championship in Baden-Baden. As three year before, Harry and John are sitting right next to each other in the audience. From the left side of the auditorium they have a glorious view of the judges on stage, who announce the prizes for the eight categories. Harry jiggles his right foot up and down, he hasn’t said a word ever since they arrived at the theatre. John can physically feel the strain in his friend’s body, who’s clearly getting nervous. The third prize in manipulation goes to Jon Lönnquist, a guy from Sweden. Austrian Fred Sherry runs up to the stage to claim the second award. This year, there is a number one, a chance to finally be the best of the world. The prize of the world champion in manipulation goes to… the Dutch magician Tel Smit. </p>

<p class="text">
Harry’s face grows pale and his smile freezes. Could the reaction of the audience be really that misleading? The last three years of work rush through his brain in milliseconds, the countless hours he spent practicing his performance every day, all the philosophical books he read, the sounds of 24 vinyl records he mixed together. The make-up classes, costumes, the cloths he accidentally set on fire and all that money. How could his instincts fail him like this? </p>

<p class="text">
But then, the judges call Di Sato on stage. My grandfather jumps out of his seat, as if he was catapulted from it, taking large steps towards the front. Susurration goes through the audience when the man reveals his face. Di Sato? That’s Harry Thiery. My grandfather is the winner of the Grand Prix, the highest and most important prize in the world of magic. </p>

<h3 class="chapter1">
Chapter 3: Jean Merlin </h3>

<p class="text">
The summer of 1967 changed Harry’s life forever. “When you win a grand prix, everybody wants you”, Jean Merlin tells me. My grandfather was soon booked for tours in Lebanon, Japan, France, Switzerland, everywhere. He travelled abroad for several weeks or months, separated from my grandmother and their two little boys. But he made lots of money and got to enchant people all over the world. </p>

<p class="text">
Jean and I are sitting in a busy restaurant close to Place de la Nation, in the east of Paris. We’ve  been exchanging emails for over a year, but only because I was struggling to find a room when I first moved to the French capital for my master’s degree. Back then, my grandmother gave me the details of an old friend who lived there and offered help. But only when I researched Harry’s colleagues did I find out that Jean, too, was a famous magician. He and my grandfather travelled the whole of Africa together. </p>

<p class="text">
“You’re French improved a lot”, he says after only a couple of sentences. “It’s way better than your grandfather’s”, he adds. Wait. There is something that Opa Harry wasn’t good at? I can’t help but feel a slight sense of pride building up inside me. “It always bothered him. But I was the only French guy who was fluent in Dutch, that’s how I got his attention”, he recalls. Jean Merlin was only 19 years old when he saw my grandfather on stage in Barcelona. “I loved the act. I wouldn’t say I loved the guy, but I really loved the act”, he says. Almost a decade later, the young conjurer would witness first-hand how my grandfather’s life slowly began to fall apart. </p>

<p class="text">
The sun is shining over the city of Douala, Cameroon in 1972, when Jean Merlin, Harry and eight other young magicians prepare their act. Harry’s Di Sato number is one of the most elaborate, it takes him over an hour to set up the props that he carries everywhere, 100 kilograms packed in four metal flight boxes. The mood is tense, they have been performing for weeks, getting up early every morning to fly to yet another city on the African continent. Obligatory drinks with country representatives every night, answering the same questions, laughing about the same anecdotes. </p>

</div>

<div class="col">

<p class="text">
“After three weeks, we were really tired”, Jean Merlin remembers. He was the youngest of the group and the only one still alive. “But after a few drinks, your grandfather was very funny. He had a lot of jokes”, he says. Harry loved to trick his neighbours at the table: he took away watches from their wrists, necklaces, wallets. Only to put them in a situation where they would figure it out themselves. “Oh, you lost your hotel keys? Well, you really shouldn't have left them there”, Jean says, imitating my grandfather. He loved to make people completely crazy, that’s why everyone has been telling me. </p>

<p class="text">
But this night in Douala was different: no drinks, no laughter, no table manipulations. Harry is on stage, conjuring his sphere as the satan, performing the same act as every night since he won the world championships. Zzziiiish, a death’s head appears on the pillar on the left side of the stage. Fog is fleeing from every crack. Thunderclaps, smoke, devilish laugh, more smoke, gone - the devil disappears. </p>

<p class="text">
Harry can’t see the audience, too bright are the headlights pinning down his every move from the back of the hall, but he can hear that something’s not right. No clapping. Where are the shouts of joy? Not even confusion, just silence. Someone is slamming the heavy entrance door. Only when the lights let go of him, Harry begins to realise what’s going on. In front of him a bishop, the mayor and several policeman. Pale faces in the audience, noone says a word. </p>
